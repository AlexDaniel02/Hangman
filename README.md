# Hangman
The program reads a list of words from a text file called input.txt, then asks the user to enter the number of maximum errors (how many wrong guesses can he take).
After each try, the letter is verified and the program prints a message.
The player wins if he guessed every letter. If he guessed wrong too many times, he loses.
